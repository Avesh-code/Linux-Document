# Day 3 (09/10/2025) of Linux
Today I have started with Azure virtual machine and learn to get connection through SSH and After That i will watch the Youtube Video of Linux which was left 1:58:00 and learn sytem level Commands.
> ## SSH Connection
`chmod 400 <Private-key-path>` : this is for protecting the private key over Network and giving only read permission for owner.  
`ssh -i <Private-key-path> <username>@<ip/dns>` : It will connect to Virtual machne.  
`exit` : to close the session.
