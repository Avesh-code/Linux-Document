# Day 3 (09/10/2025) of Linux
Today I have started with Azure virtual machine and learn to get connection through SSH and After That i will watch the Youtube Video of Linux which was left 1:58:00 and learn sytem level Commands.
> ## SSH Connection
`chmod 400 <Private-key-path>` : this is for protecting the private key over Network and giving only read permission for owner.  
`ssh -i <Private-key-path> <username>@<ip/dns>` : It will connect to Virtual machne.  
`exit` : to close the session.  

> ## System-level commands
`uname` : It tells About os name.  
`uptime` : it tells about system running time.  
`which <command/tool>` : It tells the location of the command file through which it runs.  
`id` : it tells about the UsarID, groupId.  
`sudo` : super user do permission.  
`shutdown` : It will give schedule time for shutdown and it will automatically shutdown at that time.  
`reboot` : It will Restart the system.  
`apt` : command line package manager used for installing packages and managing them.  
Example:  
`sudo apt-get update` : it will get the update path file which are required for installing any package.   
`sudo apt-get install docker.io` : it is used to get the docker and install it in system.  
`sudo apt remove docker.io` : it is used to remove the docker and uninstall it from software.

> as apt is used for linux then for diffrent diffrent os there is a diffrent package manager

For Example: yum->centOS, dnf->fedora, pacman->arch linux, portage->chromeOS, rpm->redhat.  

> ## users and Group Management Commands:

`sudo useradd -m <username>` : this Command is used for add a new user with Proper separate directory (-m).  
`sudo passwd <username>` : To set the password for the new user.  
>for checking users in system you can see at `cat /etc/passwd`

`su <username>` : To switch the user.  
> `exit` : to exit the other user

`sudo userdel <username>` : to delete the user.  
`sudo groupadd <groupname>` : to create a new group.  
`sudo gpasswd -a <username> <groupname>` : to Add a user into that group we use this -a indicates "add".  
`sudo gpasswd -M <username1> <username2>,<username3> <groupname>` : To add multiple user into one group.  
`sudo groupdel <groupname>` : To delete the specific group.
