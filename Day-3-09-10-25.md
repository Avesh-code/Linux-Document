Today I have started with Azure virtual machine and learn to get connection through SSH and After That i will watch the Youtube Video of Linux which was left 1:58:00 and learn sytem level Commands.

`chmod 400 <Private-key-path>` : this is for protecting the private key over Network and giving only read permission for owner.  
`ssh -i <Private-key-path> <username>@<ip/dns>` : It will connect to Virtual machne.  
`exit` : to close the session.

`uname` : It tells About os name.  
`uptime` : it tells about system running time.  
`which <command/tool>` : It tells the location of the command file through which it runs.  
`id` : it tells about the UsarID, groupId.  
`sudo` : super user do permission.  
`shutdown` : It will give schedule time for shutdown and it will automatically shutdown at that time.  
`reboot` : It will Restart the system.  
`apt` : command line package manager used for installing packages and managing them.  
Example:  
`sudo apt-get update` : it will get the update path file which are required for installing any package.   
`sudo apt-get install docker.io` : it is used to get the docker and install it in system.
